Usage: python TraP_fits_QC.py <sigmaClip> <sigmaRej> <f> <frequencies>


Requirements:
os, pyfits, glob, sys, numpy, scipy, math, matplotlib
tools.py
getRMS.py

1. The script measures the RMS values for all fits images in the working directory
2. It then produces a histogram and fits a Gaussian distribution (n.b. currently in Log space, reasonable?)
3. The sigma thresholds are then calculated and images are sorted into good/bad.
4. The mean RMS and +/- 1 sigma values are output onto the screen and the histogram image is saved
5. The good images are written into "images_to_process.py" which can be input directly into TraP. Some versions of TraP allow for an alternative, thus Minimum and Maximum values are also output.
6. Tools has been updated (July 2018) with boostrapping for small image batches.

   <sigmaClip>	   : The sigma clipping threshold to be used to calculate the RMS (use identical value to that in TraP settings)
   <sigmaRej>	   : The sigma clipping threshold to be used to reject images following the fitting of a Gaussian to all the RMS values
   <f>	     	   : The fraction of the image to be used to calculate the RMS (use identical value to that in TraP settings)
   <frequencies>   : Do you create sigma thresholds for each of the individual frequencies used in the dataset (best for data with multiple bands) or fit a single distribution? ("T"/"F")
